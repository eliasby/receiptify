# Receiptify Frontend

You can use PNPM, Yarn or NPM. In my case I used PNPM, which can be installed (if not already) by following the guide [here](https://pnpm.io/installation), or the with following command:

```shell
corepack enable
```

Install dependencies:

```shell
pnpm install
```

Make sure the backend is running as mentioned on the `README.md` found in the root of this repository.

Run in development mode:

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

Run tests:

```shell
pnpm run test
```
